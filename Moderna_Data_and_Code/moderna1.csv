J and J haunted their study due a volunteer got an “unexplained illness” they refused to say what. And then some have described their reactions as straight up c 19 symptoms.  Moderna has a severe adverse event of 80% low dose gr and 100% bad reactions in high dose gr.

Isn't that the million dollar question! Firstly, Australia will probably distribute vaccines free to public (PBS). So we are really talking about ""bulk buying"" cost. Aus Gov should get some good discount from Pfizer or Moderna. But has to cover distribution instead.

I think the

Pfizer is likely to release Phase 3 data this week and apply for Emergency Use Authorization within two weeks, with limited availability following quickly after that.

Moderna is less than a month behind, then probably Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Novavax by February or so.

I also participated in the Pfizer study - my 2nd shot was the day after Astra-Zeneca halted their study due to an adverse event. It was a little scary, tbh! But I felt a need to do something & this is what I could do. Spouse did the Moderna study - diversifying our risk somewhat.

Secondly, Moderna had been working on a MERS vaccine for years and was very close to clinical trials. Because MERS is also caused by a coronavirus, it was easily adapted to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and much of the initial research leading up to trials didn't have to be repeated.

Dry ice is good enough.  The difference between -80°C and -78°C is not meaningful.

Moreover, purified RNA can still be stored for years at -20°C if prepared appropriately, which is consistent with Moderna's guidance for its own mRNA vaccine.
researchgate.net
How long can you store cDNA, RNA and DNA in -20?
I need my samples for long-term, but I was told that you can not keep DNA and RNA longer stored than a week in -20

Yep! Moderna uses a less heat-sensitive lipid nanoparticle, which is the ""secret sauce"" in these vaccines and allows them to be absorbed intracellularly and preserves the unstable mRNA before it degrades.

i see what you mean but 30,000 people were enrolled and this is a preventative measure among the many others they were likely taking (masks, distancing, etc.) so that number is not unexpected AND it is the DIFFERENCE between the numbers (90 in placebo; 5 in vaccine) that matters.

I certainly see an ethical argument for letting placebo folks know, but as soon as it’s revealed, it risks changing participant behaviours, psychological factors, etc. Surprising if 95 cases is indeed interim not final data for analysis.

Yes. The LNP has several functions, but the most important is probably stability as mRNA is inherently incredibly unstable. Likely there is zero difference in efficacy between Pfizer and Moderna mRNA, unless one LNP is less effective at getting it inside the cell. Unlikely.

Even so - they seem to be quoting a price at the mo of £3, which is 1/10th of the Pfizer price. Even if they went up to £9, that’s still significantly less, surely. And they’re doing deals for local production all over the place, including India.
Still, there’s a way to go yet...

For folks with [at least some] prior/natural immunity, does it complicate the safety assessment of vaccines?

Is it a reasonable concern that prior immunity could cause an adverse reaction to a vaccine? 

Is the answer to this different for mRNA-based vs other types of vaccines?

No it's up to 90 efficacy with a half dose first and full dose second. For some reason when two full doses are given, it comes out at about 75 percent efficacy. It  can also be stored at 2 degrees Celcius. As opposed to 60 or 70 below.which makes transportation easier...

SARS vaccine is much easier than Zika and Rabies. 
1. SARS vax is developed during an active pandemic - plenty of people to enroll
2. Zika cause very mild symptoms to adult, but severe birth defect. Rabies, 100% death. Both are hard to design a powered & ethical clinical trial.

Pfizer has been testing in adolescents & teens, ie 12 up. Moderna is starting to do that. Manufacturers will have to do special dosing studies in younger kids. That work still needs to be done. Kids are likely going to be at/near the back of the vaccine line.

 I may have heard the doc wrong. But you need to take the full (2 jabs) and not cut corners. If this delays people coverage a few weeks so what; you need the correct dosage (2 jabs); its like stopping a course of antibiotics midstream.

That's why I think it depends on how likely delays are. If you are pretty confident more supply is coming, it seems worth the risk.  If there is a decent chance it'll be a month or more late, it probably isn't.

Ha ha. Thanks, John. The Moderna is a lipid-nanoparticle. So it can go to the LN directly and transduce LN stromal cells there, which can produce and present the Ag to LN B cells. Interesting that though it doesn't have the secretory signal sequence. Need to dig.

I agree, let Pfizer and Moderna sell it here. The government would then not have to bother to administer to people who can afford. That will ease a lot of pressure. But first we need to vaccinate health care workers and people over 60. Vaccines have not been cleared for children.

The epidemiology of all of this will be a goldmine - all use the spike protein but adverse events are going to likely diverge based on vaccine and adjuvant platform with millions getting different vaccines; some traditional attenuated adenovirus-based, others mRNA-based.

The estimated vaccine efficacy after the 1st (82%), between 1st and 2nd (52.4%) and after the second dose (95%) are all impressive! However, high affinity Ab and long term immunity likely require the 2nd dose and we should all adhere to the recommended regimen. (2/n)

As a public health professional, I share your concern about the diabetes epidemic. However, when one looks at *population health* the blame is not just on individuals but on the population changes that have made diabetes and obesity more common.

Exactly, he told people not to freak out about Covid, but now is freaking out about 1 or 2 events. People need to realize when large numbers of people are involved, bad things will happen to some because bad things occur all the time—doesn’t mean the vaccine did it even.

305,000 deaths from Covid. There are factors that modify the course/severity of the disease, but infectivity not affected. Novel virus - so the key is preventing exposure to a significant inoculum (ie. need for masks, distancing, etc.). Why do you think pro athletes get it?

1st: 99.9% survival would imply that ~100% of the US has had COVID. 315K dead / 330mm population. So you're wrong.

2nd: Even if it were true, 1 in 1,000 odds of death seems a lot worse compared to a ""rate of serious adverse events is less than 0.5 percent"".

I suppose if this vaccine reduces symptoms, but doesn't reduce almost all transmission, this could cause people who don't know they are sick to be out and about. Also much more transmission is from symptomatic individuals. Some asymptomatic cases could be a dud test. Lots even.

Trying to vaccinate healthcare workers first is really slowing the show down. The logistics of ranking us by likelihood of exposure and implement strict adherence to this is, well, slow. Maybe we should quickly divvy up the rest to CVS/Walgreens and let loose?

If they have data that says it's not worth our time, they should share it. Then OWS and others can make an educated decision about its value. If they don't have that data, then they should answer as to why it's not worth their $$ to test it. (See, I agree on the big issues!)

6/ Hätte eine größere Bestellung zu schnelleren Impfungen geführt?
Nein. Der Flaschenhals ist nicht die niedrige Bestellmenge, sondern die niedrige Produktionskapazität der Hersteller. Biontech hat im Juni ein EU-Darlehen über 100 Mio EUR zum Ausbau seiner Produktion erhalten.

Concern with AZ vaccine is the disparity in efficacy between the 2-full-dose regime, or the half-then-full dose regime. We need more data. And that will take time. Meanwhile Pfizer has no evidence of reducing asymptomatic transmission (yet). We should get more Moderna if we can.

 talking vaccines now: says it would take nearly a year (47 weeks) to vaccinate the whole state if they only get 300k doses a week. 

By my count, that would be only one shot to 14 million (70% of state pop), however: the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require TWO.

 have settled on a vaccine that has a 60% efficacy, compared to 90% + for other COVID-19 vaccines...  according to below the Pfizer & Moderna vaccines are up to 2.46 times more effective. Obviously that’s a risk they’re happy to take.
Alan U. Kennington
@kennington_u
 · Jan 8
If you compare 70.4% and 95% efficacy without logarithms, the contrast is even more extreme.

(1−70.4%)/(1−95%) = 5.92.

So the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are 5.92 times better than the AZ vaccine using a linear measure.
In other words, AZ is only 16.9% as effective.

Don’t forget they just cancelled Moderna 16 million order 4 days ago, and ordered 20 million Pfizer, now Pfizer is delayed.

They got nothing right for the whole pandemic, if they were conservatives the MSM would have massacred them long before now. $600,000,000 on media helps!

Indeed! Trudeau held a press briefing this morning on that very thing, that we were going to experience a slow down, and why it was happening, and when we could expect it to start arriving again. It seems vaccine mfgs are leaving it up to each country to do their own informing.

Remember Sir Humphrey pointed out the OSA was not meant to protect secrets rather to protect officials.
Too much information out there makes them answerable, responsible and therefore potentially cornered. Ignorance is bliss, for the government.

Pfizer's #COVID19 vaccine is delayed for a few weeks. 

Ontario's Plan:

*Continue to focus vaccinating LTC to achieve pre-set goals.

*Ensure LTC residents get 2nd vaccine dose ON TIME.

*Any delays will be in non-LTC residents, as per Health Canada (<42 days).

Smart approach.

Got first shot of Moderna at beginning of month. My arm should be chock-a-block full of antibodies by now.

Chances of getting second shot on Jan 31st dimming, due to a vast shortage of vaccine. Will simply get 2nd shot when I'm able. Doctors not too concerned about any delay.

Let me dumb it down for you: 

Your personal subjective experiences don’t represent nor extend to the entire population. 

You’re trying to create a euphemism out of vaccine safety awareness. In science, we prefer safe rather than sorry. 6 cases is more than enough.

A social worker, I only learned last week that I’m in Category 1A. Hours before appts were to be given to 1B, I managed to snag an appt in manhattan–for early next week. The city expects to run out of vaccines by end of this one. And people not in 1A or B are already vaccinated.

I'd suggest that 1M/day is not very ambitious as a long-term goal. It'll take 660M doses (assuming full pop coverage, 2 doses for series completion) to cover the U.S.

That would mean a little less than two years.

OMG you are annoying! You are aware Pfizer and Moderna are doing their best to distribute vaccines globally? The UCP can’t even get organized to vaccinate healthcare workers and seniors in long term care. Get your own house in order before trashing someone else’s.

No one talks about efficacy.  I heard on MSNBC that J&J could be as low as 70% (same as Chinese SinoVac).  If that’s the case, would rather wait for Moderna or Pfizer?

You’re right that the 70% effectiveness of this is lower than the 95% of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines. But we are still so far behind on getting people vaccinated that this would be a huge help. Once everyone’s vaccinated we could focus on the better ones for future vaccinations.

I read this earlier: Regulators may be able to approve a new vaccine just based on a “bridging study”, which examines participants’ antibodies to the new variant after taking a booster, rather than a lengthy phase-3 trial, which counts how many develop Covid-19 in each trial arm.

I expect they will run rapid Ph1 trials for safety. Most peptides generated from a tweaked variant will be identical to the original vaccine, which is already proven safe. You want at least a small trial though in case a new peptide is homologous to a normal protein in the body.

Thank you as always. Wouldn't hesitate receiving the vaccine and understand that until there is a specific antibody titer test (if ever), unlike PCV13 and PPSV23 we can't quantitate COVID antibody response. Worth a shot (or 2) in our situation ( pardon the pun).

I assume that's at least part of the work currently being undertaken by Pfizer. I don't know if it's too much to hope that they're also engineering a method to increase the stability of the vaccine at higher temperatures to remove the need for cryogenics, a logistical nightmare.

Because there is a limited supply of precursors to make a vaccine.

e.g. All of the mRNA vaccines use an CAP enzyme that’s in short supply.

Other vaccines with other manufacturing techniques (inactivated virus, adenovirus vectors, subunit proteins, etc) spread the load.

I'm not sure why people are scoffing at the JnJ vaccine. If you want a vaccine that eliminates severe illness, this is as good as anything.

Prioritize JnJ for younger/low risk populations. Modern and Pfizer for older/high risk.

Then factor the ease of single dose....

Effectiveness against SA variant appears to be similar for all 4 vaccines. Assuming SA variant becomes dominant, JNJ vaccine becomes preferred based on ease of distribution, one dose vs 2. I would assume JNJ are working on targeting SA variant with a modification or booster.

Both Pfizer and Moderna were able to declare their US trial results so early because of the fact that the virus was so rampant in US that those with Placebo got infected rather quickly to meet the predefined end point. Sad in one sense, but helped in quicker roll-out.

The end points are typically defined before the trial starts. For example, the trial results will be declared to determine the vaccine efficacy once we have 190 end points in the entire trial group. Till then, they don't disclose who received vaccine or received a placebo.

In April we will be on a 100M dose a month run rate (at the least). Pfizer has said publicly they will deliver their second tranche of 100M doses by the end of May. So that’s 50M doses a month from them. Moderna and J&J should easily be able to supply an additional 50M, or more.

We must schedule for the Second vaccine dose at the same time as the first. Administer Pfizer's 2nd dose after 21 days & Moderna's after 28 days. That's how the trials for #Covid19Vaccines were conducted. Waiting for more than the prescribed time is unacceptable!

I’m guessing it has something to do with storage in fridges or freezers and once taken out, it must be used. Hence a larger vial out means more doses that need to be drawn/used in arms or else they go to waste. Probably also easier to handle for nurses.

We could have vaccinated our entire staff of 475 people in 1 day at our office. And, repeated it in 4 weeks. Instead they scrambled to schedule at more than 10 locations across 3 counties disrupting business operations for weeks. And, just now starting second round of doses.

No.
There is no evidence it is a safety risk.
And real world data is convincing that it is not.

Your algorithm is not evidence-based.
It has not been validated.
I’m honestly not sure why you keep promoting it.

1) Public health measures - in a country where up to half of the population lives in informal settlements, still work
2) Vaccines such as Novovax, J+J, possibly Moderna/Pfizer still have efficacy in hosp and death
3) More boosters down the pipeline.

In South Africa, where B.1.351 is ~100% of covid infections, containment has been achieved without vaccines, w/ submaximal mitigation. This variant can evade our immune response, a risk for reinfections, and reduces efficacy to vaccines. Nonetheless, this pattern is encouraging.

As of 14 Feb, 15,300,151 people have received at least one dose, up 237,962 on the day before.

The target is to give 32m people a first dose by 30 April.

16,699,849 still need to receive a dose within 76 days.

A daily average of 219,734 first doses will therefore be required.

This is great but I'm still waiting eagerly for data in the 50 ug cohort to show similar efficacy in reducing symptomatic & severe illness. I don't think we should half dosing until then. Besides, U.S. still needs to figure out our logistics/delivery issues.

All this is going to lead to is non compliance for a booster and probably lead to other boosters being used as a follow up especially when dealing with multivalents. I’ve seen the Moderna safety data and it is beyond scary on the multivalent front not that they will ever own it

AB levels after infection+1 dose are comparable or higher than after 2doses+no infection. so one would ""waste"" doses. in addition there have been more side effects for people who already had the infection (nothing to worry about just annoying)

How many studies are needed before we accept that people with prior covid-19 have a robust immune Ab response to a single dose of mRNA vaccines, like the 2nd dose for those with no prior covid?

What I'm most jazzed about is the decrease in severe disease for those vaccinated, even with a single dose of those requiring two. The variants obviously cast some doubt in all that, but I'd still feel a lot better having a shot in my arm. Not  a big fan of dying on a ventilator

New: The U.S. has been administering 1.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses per day on average.

Based on expected deliveries by Pfizer and Moderna, that could almost double to 3.3 million between now and the end of March, which is a big deal.

So far I’ve seen zero data on efficacy of “single dose” that was not from study where second dose was given. 

Durability of immunity with true single dose (as well as delayed 2nd dose) appears to be unknown.

Why not do bridging study before jumping off the cliff?

Is there data that shows how long immunity lasts with only 1 dose. ? Since Québec is the only one to administer only 1 dose and only has 1 month experience, it can’t possibly have lengthy data. Is it even doing double blind study to measure efficacy over 1 dose?

The question is does immunity last after a month without the second dose. These numbers are for 14-21 days after the single dose so don't say much about about longevity.

False dichotomy.

I’m advocating getting the answer via established methods.

I fear over-interpretation of incomplete data & groundswell of wishful thinking by non-experts in vaccines/immunology/epidemiology/risk assessment might lead to a worst case scenario.

That's absolutely not what these results mean. Reduced efficacy of neutralizing Abs may mean less protection against infection, but given the vaccines invoke cellular immunity as well, they still may very well protect against disease if infected.

it is your choice. Even over 85 if you are in good shape it is worth imho. Over 95 you may be indestructible. Around me, many got vaccinated, most of them over 80. All are in good shappe. half have no side effect half have mild side effects only 1 case of high blood pressure1 day

I’d had an antibody test which was negative before the jab.  I also had two Covid PCR tests both negative, one 12/26 and the other 3 days before the jab.  I thought I had sorted the prior infection out ... was tested again this week but electricity outage - no results.

Feb 19","At this point the evidence is abundant on mRNA-based vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer): they are astoundingly effective, they work within 10-14 days of the first dose, and even one dose gives 80-90% protection. 

Totally unambiguous: these vaccines save lives & will help us reopen.
