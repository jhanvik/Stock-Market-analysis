There is no real concern about the wildtype or B.1.1.7 as they don't have the key mutation on the spike protein that renders it less vulnerable to antibodies. I disagree 100% about pushing 1st dose without commitment to time-valued 2nd dose.

I have read that it’s not fair to judge J&J’s efficacy in the same way as Moderna and Pfizer because those were tested before the variants, and J&J was after. They might be more similarly effective than we think with that in mind. Plus, the whole “not dying” thing is attractive

Israel has about 38% people who received the second shot. 45% haven’t received any at all. For the full immunity to kick in, you need couple of weeks after the second shot. Adjust the numbers accordingly.

A country could literally buy the rights at the same price that is was going to pay for the doses. 

Then the country builds and manufactures their own doses much quicker. 

The pharma company then gets paid for every dose produced going forward. 

They still make huge money.

When the world leader of successful vaccines bows out of the covid vaccine development to first better understanding the virus, people need to take notice. This is Moderna’s first ever vaccine, and Pfizer has a long history of medical and ethical violations

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are doing their job against regular covid, as expected. They also do well against some of the new covid variants we're seeing, like the UK and California strains. But they aren't as good against Brazil, and not at all against South Africa.

This is outrageous. We don't even have peer-reviewed controlled clinical trial data. The rates of serious and severe events are sky-high? This is horrifying! Now we are chasing down mutations? It will never end and human risks will mount with each active intervention.

No, ivermectin's now on the long list of ineffective drugs people have tried to use to treat COVID.  Studies show it doesn't help, it's got bad side effects, and you shouldn't use it unless you've got worms, especially the vet version instead of made-for-humans version.

Just keep trying. We got my son signed up at the Walmart pharmacy for a Moderna, with no appointments available for hours, then some just magically popped up. Also, call pharmacies near the end of the day to see if they have leftover doses that need to be used. It’s a pain.

Mar 24","PSA: Moderna/Pfizer vaccines are mRNA. It's not a live virus, it does not change your DNA in any way, it never enters your cell's nucleus, & cells break the mRNA down & get rid of it soon after it is finished using the instructions, to make harmless spike proteins. It's safe.

Vaccines are an amazing way to help our robust immune systems build protective antibodies!

#COVID vaccines use mRNA blueprints (Pfizer/Moderna) or non-infectious viral vectors (J&J).

And no - they don't contain microchips, 'rearrange' our DNA or cause infection.

90% of the eventual Pfizer/Moderna vaccine efficacy was reached within 10-days of the first shot. So, within the first week of first shot a lot of caution still warranted. Beyond 10 days of first shot, of any US available vaccine, your body has learned about as much as it can

True asymptomatic cases have a much lower chance of transmitting.

Breakthrough cases after vaccination also have lower viral loads, shorter duration.

Secondary infections are probably less likely than breakthrough infections.

True asymptomatic Covid cases (people who never get symptoms) are less likely to infect others. Even if vaccines allowed very many asymptomatic cases (they don't) they are unlikely to infect many people.

I can understand economic interests may be behind a campaign to affect AZ but do you think regulators such as EMA or German PEI would fabricate medical reports of a side effect reported in 1/40k to 1/100k for AZ? (so far less than 1/million for Pfizer).

Also, Pfizer and Moderna use mRNA and these were the first ever approved vaccines using this method. J&J and AZ vaccines use a conjugate or carrier method, which is used in some vaccines but is not the most common method. Most common are inactive virus and weakened virus vaccines

Everyone should still wear masks & take distancing precautions--the variants make common-sense precautions a necessity.

He is comparing the JnJ efficacy against hospitalization/death vs overall efficacy of Pfizer/Moderna, which is not a proper comparison. Overall J&J is 66.3% effective & 100% effective against hospitalization/death. Pfizer is 91.3% effective overall & 97% effective against death

You’re correct about the essential worker vaccination program needing a revamp due to AstraZenica issues for younger people. That means Pfizer or Moderna needed. But “outbreak vaccinations” use Pfizer/M too. Which means less or none left for essential workers.

Vaccines aren't mandatory, and the B.C. government said around 3300 residents hadn't taken it.

As long as community transmission is high, that will mean sporadic outbreaks.

I was confused by this too. I think the EUA will have to wait until the CDC is done. Yes the FDA grants the EUAs. They're ""sister agencies"" within the Department of Health and Human Services. So if the FDA says it's a go, I can't see the CDC stopping them, only if HHS does.

Have you seen the 2 year old who is reported as deceased after receiving Pfizer? For that age the vaccine is more likely to harm than covid. Possibly 10+ vaccine injuries for every covid severe case in that group. Don’t know why they’re testing in kids at all.

It is infecting children. Some adults get vaccinated; others don't.
As kids return to school, sports, or attend social gatherings, they may get it and become very ill, have long term effects, & spread it to other kids/adults.

If P1 is twice as transmissible as classic COVID-19 strain, and if vaccine is just under 50% effective, does that mean that P1 vs 100% “fully vaccinated” population w/no other precautions might spread roughly as fast as classic COVID-19 w/no precautions?

Although the second shot is identical to the first, the body's reaction to the fake antigens is amplified by a factor of about 10.

The US government (The NIH) owns the patents to the PEG LNP technology. Why pFizer and Moderna are able to charge the public for a public asset is a great question for Dr. Fauci, who has trumpeted MRNA technology as his own little baby.

Don’t know.   He just said “second dose” so it’s either Pfizer or Moderna.   I told my husband today I can say I’ve seen more patients with bad vax effects than bad COVID.  I know nurses across the US and Canada who are saying the same.

FWIW, COVID is an infection for which one's natural antibodies from a prior infection (which disappate after ~6 months) are not as effective as the ""blueprint"" in the mRNA vaccine which instructs your body how to mount an immune response if you were to be reinfected.

None of the family docs in the Ottawa area have Moderna in their offices. But a doctor 3 hrs away does. That is how broken our system is. We should ALL have Moderna in our offices. Then I could go to my own family doc, here in town, since Ontario can’t figure out how to book us.

Pfizer/Moderna use lipid-encapsulated mRNA which degrades rather rapidly. So there's a booster.
J&J uses a lentivirus vector to inject DNA into the nucleus which then produces the mRNA on an ongoing basis (total time unknown).

The MSDS?  Yes that’s what I’m referring to. That’s because what you’re looking at is SM-102 in a solution of chloroform. In fact it’s 90% chloroform - so not what’s in the vaccine. Just FYI.

It's an unrealistic hypothetical, but probably Moderna. However, I'm having AZ, knowing we can always have an mRNA booster next year, incorporating more variants. 

AZ is subject to a lot of fake news. It's equivalent to Pfizer on most variants & clotting risks are decreasing.

Got my second Moderna a few days ago. Will admit, the ""flu-like"" symptoms are still kicking my butt. All I keep thinking though is that if I'm reacting this way to the mRNA, there is NO WAY I would survive covid. I'm so thankful I'll be fully vaccinated in under two weeks.

Both Pfizer and Moderna did trials in the US before the emergence of variants - which accounts for the higher rates of efficacy there. J&J, AZ, Sinopharm and others conducted trials outside the US. Added to Pfizer’s medical lobby in the US - $4M/yr avg in political donations.

Both mRNA vaccines are SUPERB as is AZ.  Superb, I say.  Take the damn vaccine.  You folks who got the Moderna first dose, get your second dose as soon as you possibly can.  I estimate an 8-12 week wait, but it could easily be sooner.  If you get the chance, GRAB IT.

I'm going to just say it. But there is ZERO reason to turn down Moderna. If you think you're allergic to Moderna, you're allergic to Pfizer. 
Both are AMAZING+EFFECTIVE vaccines. 
My husband got Moderna. 

Please stop this. The rest of the world would love to get ANY vaccine now. twitter.com/paimadhu/statu…

“when Dr. Doudna first helped create CRISPR, she had a nightmare... it was Adolf Hitler... if it fell into the wrong hands, someone might use it for eugenics.”

The speed of release on the COVID vaccine comes on the back of decade research projects in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Moderna has been working exclusively on this since its founding 11 years ago. Pfizer's vaccine is from a subsidiary called BioNTECH that's 13 years old

They still do not mention Moderna specifically, when discussing the new Indian variant. You seem to be saying it is mRNA like Pfizer and so the results transfer to Moderna...Hope you're right. It would be nice to know for sure.

They’re all unlicensed, early stage vaccines, with emergency use exemptions. Therefore, it’s reasonable to consider them as experimental. Particularly in Moderna’s case, who’ve never had a vaccine approved outside of this emergency use case.

If it helps, the research & science behind the vaccine is almost 20 years old. It’s why scientists were able to target the spike protein in the virus so quickly. Also, the Moderna vaccine was developed by a Black scientist, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett. 
nbcnews.com
Scientists were close to a coronavirus vaccine years ago. Then the money dried up.
""We just could not generate much interest,"" a researcher said of the difficulty in getting funding to test the vaccine in humans.

Not quite. Since the real end point is against severe covid-19 in this study, you can still deduce the efficacy is 100% against severe cases. Most kids do not get severe cases, therefore the efficacy is still statistically 100% effective in all participants.

These COVID vaccine trials in teens amount to fraud

2. Are confounded by MMR, ffs. We know the MMR vaccine provides significant protection against COVID, and you can bet they all had it.

primary endpoint was immunogenicity, the data on cases was just incidental. Because the efficacy result was already proven in adults they don't really need to prove it again for kids, it's enough to show that it is 1)safe and 2)produces the same antibody response

Also efficacy is defined as the reduction in attack rates, so zero cases in both placebo and treatment arms would mean 0% efficacy, but generally they wouldn't be allowed to report an efficacy result without hitting a certain number of cases, if that were their endpoint

Why would you ever choose to get an experimental vaccine with spike proteins and unknown side effects given the track record of Pfizer and Moderna etc. when the alternative is maybe getting a headache for a day with covid.

Using the Drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19 can be dangerous and even lethal. The FDA has not approved the drug for that purpose.

And Ralph Baric was reviewing the vaccine in Dec 2019.

And in Feb 2020 the vaccine was ready for clinical trials.

And by luck the Furin Cleavage Site matches with a Moderna Seq. patent incl. ""furins"", the chance for that 0,01%.

Jun 5","Swan’s incessant and lazy panicked messaging has hugely undermined our vaccination rollout. This isn’t controversial at all.

He wanted 20M Moderna, we got them, now it’s super urgent we get 40M.

Meanwhile he can’t be fucked getting his facts right, this man is out of his depth.

Nothing you've quoted there suggests that myth in the making. My recollection is Swan saying again and again, the best vaccine is the one you can have ASAP. I also recall him saying mixing vaccines is a possibility.

75% of entire population would be fantastic.  Now Canada needs to go like hell on the second doses.  Realistically, could intervals between doses not be shortened to 8 weeks, except for AZ at 8-12 weeks???  Do you have any insight or speculation on Moderna deliveries??  Thanks.

Yes. After my first Moderna shot I was 2.5 weeks late. It's not uncommon for me to be late when I'm sick, so I'm assuming it's related to the immune response. Haven't had my cycle after my second shot yet.

There's also a research survey:

One side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine could be a heavier period
It’s not a symptom that the original trials looked for.

In our family we've had Pfizer/Moderna combo and AZ/Pfizer. Whatever the combo, evidence shows safe and effective. mRNA after AZ shows no signs of serious side effects with studies and real world evidence so far. 

The best vaccine is the one you can get.

Stop me if I’m wrong, but the only crucial element is the mRNA sequence coding for the spike protein. Which is IDENTICAL in the 2 vaccines. The differences in liposomes used to carry the mRNA, and other components, are trivial. I’m a doc; just took Moderna after Pfizer first 1/2

So here’s the thing about pneumonia. And myocarditis. They are the complication, not a cause. Like saying someone died of complications from a fever. They are conditions like bronchitis and sepsis. Specifically they are secondary or tertiary infections caused by other conditions.

Yet another reason getting both Pfizer/Moderna doses is important. The first dose seems to offer 33% protection against this variant while the second bumps it up to 88%. The vaccines are holding up quite well against all these new variants. Reason #3,288 to get vaccinated!

Pfizer and Moderna reported around 95% general efficacy. 
10,200 breakthrough cases in 101 million cases is less than 0.01%.
Discounting the J&J shots and the sub-notification, I think it is fair to say real life results are at least equal to the trial results.

Great news, if it goes through. We should not allow education institutions require kids to be vaccinated.  But it’s just a part of the battle. The other MAJOR part is recognizing natural immunity and stopping mandating already recovered of ANY age to get the shots.

Maybe if Canada had a policy of what is sold here should be made here, things would not be as bad with PPE and vaccines.  CAN imported 10% of vaccines 25 yrs ago, now we import 80+% due to the conservative govt not funding that sector and successive govts ignoring it.

Yes, Pfizer or Moderna are a better 2nd shot than AZ...Canada is abandoning AZ 2nd shot, in face of Delta variant. While clotting is an issue, Delta’s attributes are the main issue. 2AZs better than nothing but not optimal.

Your vax is 1-and-done. 
@EricTopol
 is referring to mRNA 2-dose vaccines, wherein 1 dose of Moderna =~36% protective against Delta vs 2 doses Moderna = ~90% protective.

WHO Urges Fully Vaccinated People To Continue Wearing Masks As Delta Variant Spreads—But No Word...
“People cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses” in areas where community transmission is high, one official said.

Dr. Topol is a fantastic source of information and working as hard as anyone I've seen to get accurate information to the public re covid. But I call him my ""vaccine optimist"" because he does try to reinforce the view that these vaccines really do work. 

Masking remains key.

It's been shown ""real world"" efficacy in the 80%'s from studies in Canada, Britain and Scotland (vs. Delta) so at this point, since the studies are all fairly small, you might be able to safely say ""80ish"". Still very good vs. serious illness, though. Mid-90s.

I collect my Moderna spikes daily by freezing my precious bodily fluids. When there is enough to fill a large spray bottle, I defrost & decant, then head out to supermarkets to spritz on beer cans, cheap snack foods, & other anti-vaxxer delectibles. Better coverage than spewing.

currently, for mRNA 15%-25% are wasted due to opened vial. Also, 50% are wasted on vaccines with less stringint cold-chain. And I simply dont believe Pharma will reduce price even effeciency in manufacturing is achieved. But who knows",🤷,,,,[],https://twitter.com/bornwithnolegs/status/1416508289874075650

Most wastage will be due to temp and open-vial. According to WHO, 50% of vac are wasted globally. 
-mRNA frozen expires 6-months
-thawed 31 days
-opened 6hrs (10 doses/vial)

CEO of Pfizer said profit margin is ~25% which = $15 to produce 1 dose so each vial is $150 min....

The mutation introduced in moderna and Pfizer spike is the same.  It locks the ACEII receptor binding domain into the open (binding) form.  This was intended to make it a better immunogen for antibodies against the part that binds ACEII.

Instead of peddling misinformation, try doing a Google Search. The UK primarily used the Astra Zeneca vax. It's less effective against the Delta variant, and Imperial College London highlighted a lack of antibodies in AZ jabbed which prevent serious symptoms. Moderna jab works.

Even this has some problems but it shows that you can have a massive improvement from the vaccine and still have more vaccinated in the hospital. I doubt it is 90% effective against Delta. Do the math with 75% VE and you will get an even higher # of vax hospitalized.

Does ibuprofen have 100% effectiveness? Does the flu shot? NyQuil? Mmmmaaaaayyybe you're asking a bit too much. I understand your skepticism, but nothing is 100% effective. The Moderna vax has been measured as 94.1% effective; is that not good enough?

Some like Pfizer and Moderna are a bit more expensive than AZ , but the EU has got the best/lowest prices per dosis for both mRNA vaccines.

They are much better than AZ or J&J not least when the virus is the Delta variant.

Blood clots appear in less than 1 in a million patients and it's unclear in those cases that the vaccine is a causal element.

Considering your risk of dying after getting Covid-19 is significantly higher than 1 out of  a million, then the risk/reward means you should get it.

As a science grad, I'm not fond of mixing vaccines due to changing the key in the key/lock concept of antigen/antibody immune responses. You likely have a broader antibody response, just not as strong a response. That said, some armour is better than none at all
