# Stock Market Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing stock market trends** using historical price data and various financial indicators. The goal is to identify patterns, predict stock movements, and provide insights into market behavior using data-driven approaches.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of historical stock data, including:  
- **Date** – Trading date  
- **Open Price** – Stock price at market opening  
- **Close Price** – Stock price at market closing  
- **High Price** – Highest price during the trading session  
- **Low Price** – Lowest price during the trading session  
- **Volume** – Number of shares traded  
- **Technical Indicators** – Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc.  

## Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover market trends.  
- Apply **time-series analysis** to study stock price fluctuations.  
- Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast future stock prices.  

## Methodology  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values and outliers.  
- Feature engineering using **technical indicators** such as Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.  
- Normalizing stock price data for improved model performance.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualizing stock price trends over time.  
- Identifying volatility using standard deviation and Bollinger Bands.  
- Analyzing trading volume patterns.  

### 3. **Stock Price Prediction Models**  
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** – Time-series forecasting.  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)** – Deep learning-based stock price prediction.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** – Machine learning model for non-linear stock trends.  

### 4. **Model Evaluation**  
- Comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices.  
- Analysis of trend accuracy using visualization techniques.  

## Outputs  

### 1. Key Insights  
- Stocks exhibited **seasonal patterns**, with price spikes around earnings reports and major news events.  
- **Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD** provided strong signals for bullish and bearish trends.  
- **LSTM-based prediction** captured short-term fluctuations effectively, while **ARIMA** worked well for long-term forecasting.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  
- ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning and deep learning models can be used for stock market analysis and prediction**. While **LSTMs** performed well for forecasting, **technical indicators and ARIMA models** provided valuable insights for long-term investment decisions.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement **Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive trading strategies.  
- Develop a **real-time stock price prediction dashboard**.  
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** using financial news and social media data.
