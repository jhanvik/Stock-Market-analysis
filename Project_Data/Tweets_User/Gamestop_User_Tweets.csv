I agree with you on that
but those brands are not paying (per sq metre)

 needs to cut back on the funko pops and get more into games. 30% of the store are pops and 30% are t-shirts and book bags. they should sell select PC hardware and board games. they should give people who bought the game from them a better trade in value.

I literally have two different orders in my fedex app. I only ordered one PS5. I don’t know if it’s set to arrive on the 18 or the 21 or maybe it was split into two deliveries. Only time will tell. 

All it says is “label created” for both. Different tracking numbers.

Exactly. I’d send that shit back for a refund, since that’s unacceptable. I feel like they’re more capable of getting away with it since it’s marked as “New”, since their return policy prevents returns for “new” games.

 Need like Epic to make games for Teslas.
Using some custom version of unreal engine.

And why are we turning Teslas in to a 50k gaming computer?

My DM is a bit of a foodie. So if there was something really good nearby the store we went to, he'd buy it. Panama City used to have a killer New York style pizza place. I'd volunteer just to get that.

The BEST thing about working inventories was either you worked at your store for 9 hours then drove to another store & hopefully got home before 2am or you went to inventories on your day off & worked 6 days that week.

My boyfriend is still waiting on his pre-ordered PS5 that got returned to sender without an attempted delivery and has been stuck in “awaiting carrier pickup” status for re-shipment for over a month and keeps getting pushed back. Support hasn’t helped. Why should we try again?

Step 0: Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow. Citadel gets to see RH's orders a few milliseconds before they're filled. Citadel may choose to front-run some of those trades.

Step 1: RH's customers and WallStreetBets start manipulating $GME. This is happening in the open.
