I'm not sorry (except maybe about the abusive customers). I was privileged enough that for the most part, my job at AMC was ""pocket money"" not ""helping the family pay bills money."" But it showed me just how hard so-called ""unskilled labor"" is. And I had bills-paying coworkers.

This is the shitty thing. 
People like you who jump into any trend..
No one will tell you when to sell, because that‚Äôs the whole point. No one knows. 

We‚Äôre holding AMC based on the research we‚Äôve done regarding HF‚Äôs and their short %.

The short ladder is so obvious. Hedges are trying to crush us and force us to sell. I‚Äôm not advising you NEED to stay in but the more research you do the more comfortable you feel about AMC and GME. They bottomed out at the exact same today. This will reverse direction

Anything is possible. Assuming they dumped on the top. The lower the price goes the easier to squeeze the shorts next round. If I wear in their shoes I'd wait till weak hands dump their bags & market to stabilize a bit then FOMO buy. Problem is  RH won't allow to own > 100 shares

What is the point in selling $AMC when it is down this far? There is no way it stays this low forever‚Äîespecially when more people are vaccinated & the world opens back up. All this has done is make $AMC a long hold for me.

 You should buy $AMC 
@AMCTheatres
 based on the fact that going to the movies is a part of American culture.  

Buying at $7 dollars a share will cause a short squeeze and you will quadruple your money once the economy is open.

Esport events in cinemas/movie theatres have been tried before and it‚Äôs a very hard market and concept. Esports is such a digital phenomena that getting people to the theatres for live broadcasts on a regular basis is really hard. Hard to see the big money on that one.

$AMC is a stock, one of many.

I traded 2 biotech stocks today before I had lunch.

$PDSB and $PAVM

Sold PDSB, bought PAVM.

But I'm STILL holding $AMC

Why?

Why bother you may ask?

Because it's not just about money.
